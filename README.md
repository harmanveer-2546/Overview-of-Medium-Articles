# Overview of Medium Articles 

Medium is a place to read articles on the Internet. Medium is a blogging platform, like WordPress or Blogger. Medium is the new project from the guys who brought you Twitter.

“Medium is not about who you are or whom you know, but about what you have to say.”– Erik Devaney

Almost everyone will agree that Medium is a great place to share your story. As a writer, I have found that it’s simple, clean, and easy to use. Almost anyone can produce a great-looking story within minutes.
